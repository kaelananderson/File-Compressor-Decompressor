# File-Compressor-Decompressor

Compress is a Java program that takes an ascii file from the command line and shrinks it using the 
methods of HashTableChain and its separate chaining hashmap. It produces a binary file of the compressed 
file. It also makes a log file that keeps track of the file being compressed, the time elapsed, and the 
total times rehashed. Likewise, Decompress takes the compressed binary file and reproduces the originally 
given ascii file by perfect hashing. It also makes a log file that keeps track of the file being compressed, 
the time elapsed, and the total times rehashed. I implement the KWHashMap interface in the HashTableChain class 
that performs separate chaining and hashmapping.
