Below is a small report I wrote for my Ethics and Justice in Food Systems course while studying abroad in Florence, Italy.
One of the most interesting aspects of our visit to La Bottega di Libera Terra was the use of product names that honored the victims of the mafia. 
For example, the wine bottles the staff pointed out which were named after individuals who lost their lives while fighting against organized crime. 
This unique approach added a personal touch to the products, reminding those who visit the shop and buy the products of mafia violence and the importance of supporting groups that combat this. 
As the two women were talking with us, I wondered if Il Villaggio Dei Popoli, which promotes fair trade and underrepresented groups, also uses similar naming marketing for their products. 
It would be interesting to compare and contrast these two places as they seem to have a similar broader goal but differ in their specific aims and operations. 
Another thought that crossed my mind during the visit was the question of the safety of shops like La Bottega di Libera Terra. 
Given that they are actively engaged in fighting against the mafia, are they under any potential danger or attacks from the mafia? I have respect and gratitude for the two women working at La Bottega di Libera Terra and the others who work there too as they are taking a courageous stand against the mafia.
